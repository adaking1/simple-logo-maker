## Description
This application is a simple logo maker. It can be very useful for freelance web developers, or any other professional that do not want to pay a graphic designer for a logo. This app was created using node.js and its built in file system, as well as inquirer, is-Color and jest from npm.

## Installation
Install this application by first installing node.js to your machine. Then, install npm, inquirer version 8.2.4, is-Color and jest from npm.

## Usage
[Usage Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ye8waATmOEVz-Uu8xNjdYpTMuF0av3cH/view)  
Start this application by first making sure that your terminal is located in the folder that holds the index.js file for this project. Type "node index.js" into the terminal to run the app. You will then be asked prompts through inquirer. The first prompt asks you to enter the text for your logo using up to three characters. The next prompt asks what color you would like the text. Next, you will be asked to select a shape from a list of three options (circle, square, triangle). After you select one, then the last prompt will ask you what color you want that shape. After all the prompts are answered, a logo.svg file is created and added to the current folder, and in the terminal "Generated logo.svg" is console logged.

## Contributing
To contribe, fork the project, create a branch to work on, edit that branch, and then create a pull request. If the edits are approved, your contributions will be added.

## Tests
Two test files were created in this repository that tests each subclass in the shapes.js folder, as well as each variable in the Text class in the text-svg.js file.. To run these tests, type "npm run test" into the terminal. The tests should pass, proving that the information from these four classes is being rendered correctly.
